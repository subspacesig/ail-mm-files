<p>Following a decision by the Central Election Commission at request of the Prosecutor General to revoke the immunity of Bulgarian presidential candidate Boyan Rassate, after he was involved in a violent attack on an LGBTI community centre this weekend,  Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Europe, Massimo Moratti, said:  <br><br>“Boyan Rassate is reported to have been among those who attacked the Rainbow Hub Community Centre, destroying property and assaulting at least one person. The decision to revoke Boyan Rassate’s political immunity must be a first step in ensuring that all those behind this vicious attack are investigated and brought to justice. <br><br>“Bulgarian authorities must now take urgent measures to stop politicians and political parties from scapegoating the LGBTI community and make clear that this kind of violence has no place in politics. Crucially, they must amend the law to recognize homophobic and transphobic violence as hate crimes. There is no doubt that the attack on the Rainbow Hub Community Centre was motivated by hatred, and this appalling incident has exposed the shortcomings of Bulgaria’s laws and justice system.<br><br>“Rainbow Hub Community Centre is an initiative providing capacity building and support to the LGBTI community in Bulgaria to mobilise and advocate for their rights. We applaud their vital work defending LGBTI rights, and stand with them in the face of hatred.”<br><br>Background <br><br>On 30 October 2021, a group of around ten people led by Boyan Rassate, according to witness accounts, an ultra-nationalist Bulgarian National Union party politician running for the presidential office in elections planned for 14 November, interrupted a trans rights event at the Rainbow Hub Community Centre in Sofia. Rassate was recognised and identified by activists present in the venue. <br>Boyan Rassate punched a woman in the face and was armed with a knife which he used to slash the tyres of a scooter parked.<br><br>As a presidential candidate, he has political immunity, but this does not apply to any criminal activities. The immunity can be revoked by the Central Election Commission at the request of the Prosecutor’s Office.  <br><br>FOR MORE INFORMATION OR TO ARRANGE AN INTERVIEW CONTACT Stefan Simanowitz on press@amnesty.org<br> <br><br></p>

<ul><li><strong><em>Two children were shot, one fatally, during a gunfight between armed groups and Indonesian security forces in Intan Jaya regency, Papua province</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Local residents told Amnesty International they believed shots came from nearby military command post</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Hundreds of residents fled to churches</em></strong></li></ul>



<p>The Indonesian government should promptly, thoroughly, independently, transparently and effectively investigate the death of one child and the injury to another after two children were shot amid a gunfight between armed groups and Indonesian security forces in Intan Jaya regency, Papua Province, said Amnesty International today.&nbsp;<br><br>Amnesty International talked to seven persons about the recent gunfight in Intan Jaya regency. They said that one of the victims, a two-year-old child, died hours after the shooting. The sources also told Amnesty International that they believed the shots that struck the victims came from the direction of a nearby military command post.&nbsp;<br><br>“Authorities must conduct a prompt, thorough, independent, transparent and effective investigation into the shooting,” said Amnesty International’s Indonesia Executive Director Usman Hamid.&nbsp;<br><br>“Anyone suspected to be responsible must be brought to justice in fair trial. Authorities must ensure access to justice and effective remedies for the victims and their families.”<br><br><strong>Children caught up in gunfight&nbsp;</strong><br><br>The two children were shot during a gunfight between Indonesian security forces and armed groups on the evening of 26 October 2021.&nbsp;<br><br>Local sources told Amnesty International that the victims were at home in a residential area near the Koramil (military command) post in Sugapa district when the shooting took place. The Koramil post is situated in an elevated area, while the houses are about 200 metres away on lower ground.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the victims, a two-year old child (NS), was hit in the stomach. Photos obtained by Amnesty International show a bullet wound in the child’s stomach. According to local sources, he died the following morning. The second victim, a six-year-old child, was shot in the back. Amnesty International obtained photos showing the injury.<br><br>The two children were reportedly brought to the local health unit immediately after being shot, but they did not receive medical treatment because no health workers were present. Local sources told Amnesty International that the six-year-old survivor is currently in hospital.<br><br>Local sources have expressed concern that Indonesian military forces may have entered the residential area to seek retribution after a soldier was injured in a shootout with an armed group in the area earlier on Tuesday. According to monitoring by Amnesty International, when a shootout between the military and Papuan armed groups results in military casualties, security forces often seek out members of armed groups in nearby residential areas, which often results in civilian deaths.&nbsp;</p>


<blockquote class="blockquote is-lined" style='quotes:"“" "”" "‘" "’"'><p>The government should protect civilian lives, including children, during security operations and provide medical and humanitarian assistance to those affected</p>
<cite>Richard Pearshouse</cite></blockquote>


<p><br>The Papuan police claimed on Wednesday that the two children were shot by an armed group while they were outside their homes.&nbsp;<br><br>The situation in Sugapa district remains tense. Local sources told Amnesty International that the gunfight between armed groups and Indonesian security forces started on Monday evening (25 October) and continued on 29 October. As the conflict escalated, hundreds of villagers in Intan Jaya fled their homes to churches.&nbsp;<br><br>“The government should protect civilian lives, including children, during security operations and provide medical and humanitarian assistance to those affected,” said Richard Pearshouse, Head of Crisis and Environment for Amnesty International.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The intensification of conflict in Intan Jaya</strong><br><br>This incident is the most recent civilian casualty in a wider intensification of armed conflict in Intan Jaya over the last two years.&nbsp;<br><br>Since early October 2021, Sem Kobogau, a civilian resident in Sugapa district, has been missing. Local media reported that Sem Kobogau was arrested by four TNI (Indonesian military) members on 5 October 2021.&nbsp;<br><br>In September 2020, Rev. Yeremia Zanambani, a 68-year-old senior pastor in Intan Jaya, was allegedly shot, stabbed and killed by an Indonesian soldier. The National Commission on Human Rights’ investigations stated that members of the military were involved in the killing. The authorities have conducted an autopsy on his body, but are yet to announce the result. Yeremia’s family are demanding that the case be brought to Indonesia’s human rights court. A criminal investigation into the killing, however, has stalled for nearly a year.<br><br>“The increasing number of civilian casualties shows that the current approach is clearly ineffective in maintaining security in Papua,” said Usman Hamid.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>“We urge the government to reconsider its security tactics in Papua to end the cycle of violence that has caused so many civilian deaths.”</p>
